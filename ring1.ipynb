    "\n",
    "This project implements Shor's algorithm on the Quantum Rings simulator to factorize a semiprime number ùëÅ. The algorithm works by leveraging quantum period finding to determine a factor of ùëÅ\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "The code initializes a quantum provider using Quantum Rings API.\n",
    "It selects the scarlet_quantum_rings backend for execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical Preprocessing:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function gcd(a, b) determines whether ùëé and N are coprime.\n",
    "If they are not coprime, the function picks another value for ùëé\n",

    "The Inverse Quantum Fourier Transform (IQFT) extracts the period ùëü\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement collapses the quantum state into a classical result.\n",
    "Classical Post-Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "If successful, the factors are printed. Otherwise, another base ùëé is attempted.\n",
    "Visualization & Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The results are plotted as a histogram to show the probability distribution of measurements.\n",
    "The execution is monitored using job_monitor(job).\n",

    "Challenges Faced\n",
    "Quantum Rings API Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the biggest challenges was ensuring the correct integration with Quantum Rings, including:\n",
    "Using the right API token and account name.\n",
    "Selecting the right backend for execution.\n",
    "Modular Exponentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing an efficient modular exponentiation circuit is critical for Shor‚Äôs algorithm.\n",
    "A simplified version was used in this implementation, but an optimized approach would be necessary for larger numbers.\n",
    "Extracting the Period ùëü\n",
    "\n",
    "The measured quantum states must be interpreted correctly to extract the period ùëü\n",
    "\n",
    "Some results may require classical post-processing to determine valid periods.\n",
    "Choosing the Right Base ùëé\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If the chosen ùëé shares a factor with ùëÅ, the algorithm fails immediately.\n",
    "I had to implement a retry mechanism to select another base if the first attempt failed.\n",
    "Understanding the Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum circuits are probabilistic, meaning different runs might yield different results.\n",
    "The histogram visualization helped interpret the measured values and validate the extracted period.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I Learned\n",
    "Quantum Programming Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge reinforced my understanding of quantum circuits, registers, and gates.\n",
    "I gained hands-on experience with Quantum Rings‚Äô simulator.\n",
    "Shor‚Äôs Algorithm in Practice\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing Shor‚Äôs algorithm helped me understand the importance of period finding and how quantum mechanics enables efficient factorization.\n",
    "Quantum-Classical Hybrid Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum circuit performs the period finding, while classical math is used to compute the final factors.\n",
    "This highlights the hybrid nature of quantum computing.\n",
    "Debugging Quantum Circuits\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike classical programs, quantum circuits are harder to debug because measurement collapses the state.\n",
    "Visualization tools like histograms helped interpret results.\n",
    "Scalability & Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach works for small semiprimes, factoring large numbers requires:\n",
    "More optimized modular exponentiation.\n",
    "More qubits and efficient error correction."
